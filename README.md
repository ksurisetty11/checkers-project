This project should be runnable with JDK17 and Junit 4.

This project was developed as part of the CPSC 2150 Software Development course and focused on creating a command-line version of the classic game of checkers. The game allows two players, represented by 'x' and 'o', to take turns moving their pieces across an 8x8 board. Players can capture their opponent's pieces and promote their own when they reach the opposite end of the board. The game board updates dynamically to reflect each player's actions at the end of every round, ensuring an engaging and interactive gameplay experience.
